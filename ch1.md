# Intro

There are two ways of starting a VUE project

* Add a script tag that points to the vuejs cdn
* Create a starting project with vue-cli

## First method

## Second method

Install VUE globally by using Git BASH because with PowerShell you'll have [an error](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/3424#issuecomment-1155131323)

https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html

Then go to you GitHub folder and do `vue create hello-world` always with Git Bash

After that you can do `npm run serve` in the created project folder with PowerShell and open your browser pointing to localhost:8080

Install SASS loader

https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html

Create `webpack.config.js` and paste the code of SCSS

Then add in style tag `lang="scss"`
